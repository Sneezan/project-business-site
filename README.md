# Business Site (mob programming exercise 
A simple business site built in under 7 hours, using a mob-programming approach. 
It contains a hero-image, call to action button 
(non working - was meant to be linked to the form), 
a contact form and an FAQ section. 

This project was built as part of Technigo's Intro Days in our
assigned teams. This was the first time working in a mob programming
setting using VS code, liveshare and live share host server.
